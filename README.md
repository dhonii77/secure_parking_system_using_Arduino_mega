# secure_parking_system_using_Arduino_mega

This is a collaborative work for some institutional level exhibition. 
We were just planning to do something different from our regular curriculum. 
We had successfully implemented our project using three components:
-> RFID reader 
-> Arduino Mega
-> Servo motor
